# example configuration file 

# DATA is specified as type {PE,JUMP,OTHER} and 5 fields:
# 1)two_letter_prefix 2)mean 3)stdev 4)fastq(.gz)_fwd_reads
# 5)fastq(.gz)_rev_reads. The PE reads are always assumed to be
# innies, i.e. --->.<---, and JUMP are assumed to be outties
# <---.--->. If there are any jump libraries that are innies, such as
# longjump, specify them as JUMP and specify NEGATIVE mean. Reverse reads
# are optional for PE libraries and mandatory for JUMP libraries. Any
# OTHER sequence data (454, Sanger, Ion torrent, etc) must be first
# converted into Celera Assembler compatible .frg files (see
# http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.com)

#set this to 1 for Illumina-only assemblies and to 0 if you have 1x or more long (Sanger, 454) reads, you can also set this to 0 for large data sets with high jumping clone coverage, e.g. >50x

#this parameter is useful if you have too many jumping library mates. Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and 300 for the other organisms

#these are the additional parameters to Celera Assembler.  do not worry about performance, number or processors or batch sizes -- these are computed automatically.
